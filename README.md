# FavouriteAds

This is a simple app to display ads imported from a json script through the use of URLSession. Once this data has been 
received, it is displayed in a collection view where a user may select which ads to save for later. I beleive I could
have used key value coding rather that using arrays as this won't scale with more random input of arrays and some of my
efficiency could have been improved.

To add a favourite, just click on the ad you like and it is saved in your favourites tab. This is displayed when you hit the
switch.
